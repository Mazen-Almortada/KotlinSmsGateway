# üì± Kotlin SMS Gateway

This project is an Android application that turns your phone into an SMS Gateway. It runs a small web server on your device, allowing you to send SMS messages by making simple API requests to it from any other system.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Runs in the Background**: Operates as a persistent Foreground Service, ensuring it stays active even if the app is closed.
* **Simple API**: Provides a straightforward API for sending messages.
* **Local Logging**: Records all messages and their statuses (`queued`, `sending`, `sent`, `delivered`, `failed`) in a local database.
* **Clear UI**: Displays the server's IP address, Authorization Token, and a log of all processed messages.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Run the App**: Build and run the project on a real Android device using Android Studio.
2. **Grant Permissions**: When you first launch the app, it will ask for `SEND_SMS` and Notification permissions. You must grant these for the app to function correctly.
3. **Get Info**: The main screen will display:
    * **Server IP Address**: Use this IP to make requests to the gateway.
    * **Authorization Token**: This token must be included in every API request for authorization.
