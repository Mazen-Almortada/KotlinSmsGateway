# **üì± Kotlin SMS Gateway**

This project is an Android application that turns your phone into an SMS Gateway. It runs a small web server on your device, allowing you to send SMS messages by making simple API requests to it from any other system.

## **‚ú® Features**

* **Runs 24/7**: Operates as a persistent Foreground Service, ensuring it stays active even if the app is closed. You don't have to worry about it.
* **Dead Simple API**: Sending messages is easier than drinking water. Anyone can use it.
* **Logs Everything**: Keeps a record of all your messages and their statuses (queued, sending, sent, delivered, or failed). No more guesswork\!
* **Clean UI**: The app itself is organized and shows you everything you need: the IP address, your secret token, and a full log of your messages.

## **üöÄ How to Get Started \- Let's Go\!**

1. **Run the App**: First, build the project and run it on a real Android device, not an emulator.
2. **Grant Permissions**: The app will ask for a few permissions, like sending SMS and showing notifications. You have to approve them all, or it won't work, lol.
3. **Grab Your Info**: As soon as you open the app, you'll find everything you need right in your face:
   * **Server IP Address**: This is the address you'll send your requests to.
   * **The Token**: This is like your password. Save it and use it with every API request.

## **üì° API Details (The Good Stuff)**

First and most importantly, **all requests** must have the Authorization header with your token in it. Don't forget\!

Authorization: YOUR\_DEVICE\_TOKEN
